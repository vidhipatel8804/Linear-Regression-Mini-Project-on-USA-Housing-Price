🏡 Linear Regression Analysis on USA Housing Data 🏡

I developed and evaluated a Linear Regression model to predict housing prices using the USA Housing dataset. Key steps in this project include:

📊 Data Preprocessing : Prepared and split the dataset into training and testing sets.  
📉 Model Training : Created and trained a Linear Regression model to learn from the data.  
🔍 Model Evaluation : Evaluated the model's performance using MAE, MSE, and RMSE to ensure accuracy.  
📈 Prediction and Analysis : Made predictions on test data and analyzed error metrics to validate the model's effectiveness.
